## Hi there 👋, diabetes-prediction
### Diabetic Prediction System
### Overview
This Diabetic Prediction System utilizes machine learning to predict whether a patient is likely to develop diabetes based on their medical history and diagnostic measurements. The project aims to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and preventive care management, leveraging historical data and predictive analytics to identify at-risk individuals.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which is publicly available and includes diagnostic measurements from 768 female patients of Pima Indian heritage. The dataset features several medical predictor variables including the number of pregnancies, BMI, insulin level, age, glucose concentration, blood pressure, skin thickness, and diabetes pedigree function.

### Features
###### ✅ Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant 
✅ Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
✅ BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
✅ SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
✅ Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
✅ BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
✅ DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
✅ Age: Age (years)
The outcome variable is a binary classification:

###Outcome: Class variable (0 if non-diabetic, 1 if diabetic)
#Methodology
➡ Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset to handle missing values, normalize data, and split the dataset into training and test sets.
➡ Model Selection: Evaluating different machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors) to find the most effective model based on accuracy, precision, and recall.
➡ Model Training: Using the training data to train the selected model.
➡ Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using the test data, focusing on metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
➡ Feature Importance: Analyzing which features are most impactful in predicting diabetes, which could provide insights into the physiological factors most associated with the disease.
#Technologies Used
🛃 Python: Primary programming language.
🛃 Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
🛃 Scikit-Learn: For machine learning model building, training, and evaluation.
🛃 Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
